ùëÑùëèùëñùëéùë† - A Dataset on Media Bias in Search Queries and Query Suggestions

## allsides_balanced_news_headlines-texts.csv
The dataset contains 21,747 news articles collected from [AllSides balanced news headline roundups](https://www.allsides.com/headline-roundups) in November 2022. 
The AllSides balanced news feature three expert-selected U.S. news articles from sources of different political views (left, right, center), often featuring spin bias, and slant other forms of non-neutral reporting on political news. All articles are tagged with a bias label by four expert annotators based on the expressed political partisanship, left, right, or neutral. The goal of the AllSides balanced news is to offer multiple political perspectives on important news stories, for educating users on biases, and provide multiple viewpoints. Collected data further includes headlines, dates, news texts, topic tags (e.g., "Republican party", "coronavirus", "federal jobs"), and the publishing news outlet. We also include AllSides' neutral description of the topic of the articles.
Overall, the dataset contains 10,273 articled tagged as left, 7,222 tagged as right and 4,252 articles tagged as center. To provide easier access to the most recent and complete version of the dataset for future research, we provide the scraping tool.

Data was scraped on 2022-11-15 from [https://www.allsides.com/headline-roundups](https://www.allsides.com/headline-roundups).

## suggestions.csv 
The second dataset we provide consists of 671,669 search query suggestions for root queries based on tags of the AllSides biased news dataset. 
We collected search query suggestions from Google and Bing for the 1,431 topic tags, that have been used for tagging AllSides news at least five times, approximately half of the total amount of topics. 
On average, the dataset contains 469 search queries for each topic.
In total, 318,185 suggestions have been retrieved from Google and 353,484 from Bing.

The file contains a "root_term" column based on the AllSides topic tags. The "query_input" column contains the search term submitted to the search engine ("search_engine"). "query_suggestion"	and "rank" represent the search query suggestions at the respective positions returned by the search engines at the given time of search "datetime". We scraped our data from a US server saved in "location".

## allSidesScraper.ipynb
The [AllSides platform](https://www.allsides.com/headline-roundups) and the provides news is a frequently used source for high quality labeled biased news. We want to provide an easy means of retrieving the news and all corresponding information. Similar datasets have previously been produced. However, compared to the currently most recent available versions, our version includes more than 20 percent of additional articles. Furthermore, for many tasks, especially in the news domain, it is relevant to have the most recent documents available.
Thus, we provide a Python-based scraper, that scrapes all available AllSides news articles and gathers available information.
By providing the scraper we facilitate access to a recent version of the dataset for other researchers.

To run the scraper, run the jupyter notebook "AllsidesDataCrawl.ipynb", i will retreive all available documents automatically. The data will be exported as "data_allsides.csv". You will find more detailed documentation on how to run and configure the scraper in the jupyter notebook.
